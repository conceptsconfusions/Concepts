      <p>Sometimes you just want to cry. It can be incredibly cathartic. Crying out of the pit of sadness can reveal the world in new light.</p>

<p>Morita Doji&rsquo;s 1977 album &ldquo;A Boy&rdquo; is unrelentingly sad. It is also beautiful. The sorrowful melds with a hope, a dream, that maybe it might get better. This underlying complexity makes the album deeply human and moving.</p>

<p>Little is known about Morita Doji. She is private, choosing to wear a large curly wig and sunglasses when appearing in public like a Japanese Sia. She wrote all her songs and was a gifted musician with the cello and guitar. Her career began with the death of a friend when music became the outlet for her sorrow. She released seven albums and then disappeared.</p>

<p>Musically, &ldquo;A Boy&rdquo; is a folk album. But, it&rsquo;s rich string accompaniment and loose song structures have leant it the title of &ldquo;acid-folk.&rdquo; But do not approach the album as psychedelic meandering. There is no drug induced simplicity here.</p>

<p>Doji&rsquo;s album is efficient and arranged with a skill to grab the listener by the heart. Each song is distinct. Each song hits with efficiently like a machine. The simple minor-keyed songs belie complex arrangements of instruments and emotions.</p>

<p>The songs often begin in simple sadness, but over their runtime use their rich instrumentation and arrangements to explore the furthest corners of Doji&rsquo;s emotional landscape. Take the short second track, &ldquo;君と淋しい風になる (I become a lonely wind with you).&rdquo; It starts with rich layers of violin, cello, and finger-picked guitar. This transitions into the lone guitar repeating its bluesy minor chords. It has a Townes Van Zandt character. The notes fall like regret.</p>

<p>Only then a quick guitar solo comes in and adds further layers. What started as a rote bluesy ballad has gained a quick edge that fades as a soon as it arrives. One verse later a longer solo appears, this one slightly more distorted, shifting between major and minor keys, and at times searing with longing and anger. Here is a side of sorrow and loneliness often unheard, the moment when you are alone and your loneliness transforms into anger, anger at everyone and everything, anger at a sense of injustice to yourself. This song, like others on the album, reveals &ldquo;A Boy&rdquo;&rsquo;s ability to express shades of emotions we all feel and know.</p>

<p>It resembles, to my ears, Frank Sinatra&rsquo;s 1969 album &ldquo;Watertown.&rdquo; In it, he shed the blue-eyes romanticism and the club inflected sleaze for a concept, the story of a man walking through a town in the rain as he remembers his past. That&rsquo;s it. It&rsquo;s a bizarre album, but one of real beauty and emotional complexity that some argue elevates its meandering inner exploration to the status of modernist literature.</p>

<p>Take the chorus of &ldquo;I Would Love You Anyway.&rdquo; The sparse instrumentation of the album is suddenly replaced with an orchestral crescendo right as Frank belts &ldquo;&hellip;if I knew then what I know now&hellip;&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a moment of triumph in an all-around dour album, but then you realize it&rsquo;s triumphant regret, triumph in hindsight, a triumph that reassures those failing by confirming a fantasy. It&rsquo;s pathetic; it&rsquo;s also deeply human. Everyone has felt that way before. Sinatra, like Morita Doji, makes it audible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A Boy,&rdquo; like &ldquo;Watertown&rdquo;, is engaging and worth every listen because it is complex. Far from a simple peon to sadness, it presents a complex maze of emotion, full of dead ends and twists and turns. Over its runtime, Morita Doji is trying to solve this maze and come to grips with her emotions. The power of the album, its cathartic potential, is the fact that she is able to communicate this musically to the listener and let them try to work it out for themselves as well.</p>

<p>Like all great sad albums, Morita Doji&rsquo;s &ldquo;A Boy&rdquo; puts you in touch with your sadness, but then pushes you into uncertain waters. It asks that you get on intimate terms with sadness to see it as a form of self-education.</p>
